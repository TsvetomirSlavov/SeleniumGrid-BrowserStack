Open http://localhost:4444/grid/console ----- on local browser and hit enter

You will get below screen with no node connected

 need to create node and "hub will manage the nodes". Let’s create a node and then trigger the test on the node.

node -hub http://localhost:4444/grid/register

Once node is connected just open the hub Dashboard and you can see node is connected and you can see the webdriver and RC instances
By default, once node is created you will get 11 instances for WebDriver and 11 Instance of  RC
5 Firefox, 5 Chrome and 1 IE browser
It means you can run 5 FF,5 Chrome, and 1 IE browser if you want to run more test on this browser then you 
can change from the command line while creating the node.
